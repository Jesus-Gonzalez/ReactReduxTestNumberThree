Simple React and Redux boilerplate.

## Technologies Applied
* React *15.3.x*
* Redux *3.6.x*

* webpack and webpack-dev-server *1.13.2* and *1.15.2* respectively
* babel *6*
* Bootstrap *4 alpha* (loaded through CDN in /static/index.html)
* Font Awesome *4.6.3* (loaded through CDN in /static/index.html)

## About this project
Here it is another React and Redux boilerplate.

This boilerplate is pretty simple,
but it is easy to start doing some practice with it,
and start learning about React and Redux easily.

Warning:
* Not including testing libraries  
* Not ready to be linted.

## How should I run this?
Install dependencies as soon as you clone the project:  
`npm install`

After playing with the boilerplate you can run it executing: `npm start` - Then open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server`


## Something else?

Feel free to fork the project, copy it, play with it or whatever you like.
This is a very basic boilerplate to get started with, so you do not struggle
starting your React project, but I highly recommend creating one on your own.

I'll soon link to a more advanced boilerplate `AvancedReactReduxBoilerplate`
which will include routing with React Router,  
linting, and testing with mocha, chai and enzyme libs

Stay tuned! :)
