# Simple React/Redux Boilerplate

## About this project
Here it is another React and Redux boilerplate.

This boilerplate is pretty simple,
but it is easy to start doing some practice with it,
and start learning about React and Redux easily.

Warning:
* Not including testing libraries  
* Not ready to be linted.

## Something else?

Feel free to fork the project, copy it, play with it or whatever you like.
This is a very basic boilerplate to get started with.

As soon as I continue progressing, I will be creating another repo called:  
`advanced-react-redux-boilerplate`

Stay tuned! :)
